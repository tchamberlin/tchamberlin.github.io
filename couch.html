</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I currently have a home theater setup in my living room. However, the room is not well-suited for it at all, so it's been quite the endeavor. I have one wall covered by the screen, another covered by windows, and another angled awkwardly in relation to the screen. That leaves the back wall for viewing movies.</p>
<p>Currently I have two couches along the back wall, each angled across a corner there. But they don't really fit very well and it leaves a lot of wasted space behind them. So, I'd like to build a couch that covers the entirety of the back wall.</p>
<p>Additionally I'd like to place a second couch along the &quot;awkward viewing&quot; wall, but be able to relocate it in order to watch movies. This means I'll need to loft the back couch -- sort of like stadium seating.</p>
<p>Still in the planning phases of this, but I think I can attach the legs of the back couch on axles so that it can be lofted up/down when needed. More images incoming shortly, but this should give a general idea at least:</p>
<img alt="Lofted couches" src="/images/couch.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>As always, here's the model. Click on this to view it interactively. It can also be downloaded and examined more closely in SketchUp, if you're into that sort of thing:</p>
