</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I currently have a home theater setup in my living room. However, the room is not well-suited for it at all, so it's been quite the endeavor. I have one wall covered by the screen, another covered by windows, and another angled awkwardly in relation to the screen. That leaves the back wall for viewing movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I have two couches along the back wall, each angled across a corner there. But they don't really fit very well and it leaves a lot of wasted space behind them. So, I'd like to build a couch that covers the entirety of the back wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally I'd like to place a second couch along the &amp;quot;awkward viewing&amp;quot; wall, but be able to relocate it in order to watch movies. This means I'll need to loft the back couch -- sort of like stadium seating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still in the planning phases of this, but I think I can attach the legs of the back couch on axles so that it can be lofted up/down when needed. More images incoming shortly, but this should give a general idea at least:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is, complete with our favorite creepy dude (for scale):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Rocking Chair with Creepy Dude" src="/images/rocking_chair_with_creepy_dude.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here it is, blissfully in his absence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Rocking Chair" src="/images/rocking_chair.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/DEA3250Flipbook/DEA3250notes/sitting.html"&gt;ergonomic guidelines&lt;/a&gt; I found, I went with a 5° seat angle, 10° back angle. and this information on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rockingchairuniversity.com/rocker-radius.html"&gt;rocker radius sizing&lt;/a&gt;. (with respect to vertical).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I avoided fancy angles here since it is the first draft. In the future I might have the seat/rockers taper towards the back -- not sure if there's an actual purpose to that other than aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haven't actually started on this one yet, but I have it modeled out. Here it is with eight creepy dudes all staring at each other (for scale):&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my second attempt at a hammock stand. Like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thomaschamberlin.com/hammock-stand-v1.html"&gt;the first&lt;/a&gt;, it will hold three hammocks, but this resolves a few issues that I've had with the first one since getting it built:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Hammock Stand" src="/images/hammock_stand_v2.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This iteration will be significantly larger, due to issues hanging the hammocks adequately high in the first iteration. I'll be using higher-quality wood, too -- the first one was done with construction pine and I'll need to paint it if I want it to last outdoors. I'm hoping to pick up some sort of hardwood that is more durable and stain it this go-round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I'll actually end up using the eye lags to hang the hammock; the ones I'd feel comfortable using are really expensive. I'll just using webbing again -- cheap, durable, and doesn't permanently alter the structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the plan for the next iteration. I currently have the three benches and the vertical H-frame built; pictures coming soon. The rest is awaiting the next burst of motivation...&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I built a hammock stand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Picture of the completed hammock stand" src="/images/hammock_stand_v1.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inspired by the ENOpod, but it's $500 for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://www.rei.com/product/895845/eno-enopod-3-person-hammock-stand" src="/images/enopod.jpg" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to make one out of wood instead. As with all new projects I drafted this out in SketchUp prior to building it. In this case it was essential, because calculating the funky angles would have been miserable by hand. Hadn't done double-angled cuts before, so that was fun to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ended up coming out way too short due to some bad assumptions in the modeling phase. So it does work, but it's not ideal -- hammocks need to be a little too flat, which means it isn't as comfortable as it could be. Still awesome, but in the next iteration I'll fix this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another side effect of the shortness is that the webbing (purple bits) connecting the hammock carabiners to the frame have to be tied in an awkward location. When weight is applied they end up getting shoved down into the gap between the top of the frame and the brace there, which pulls it apart a bit -- not good.&lt;/p&gt;
